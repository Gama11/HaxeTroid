So first thing we want to do is initial setup. Let's get acquainted with our three starter classes:

Main
PlayState
AssetPaths

Main is by default the first thing that runs in a HaxeFlixel game. If there's anything you want to run once and at the very beginning, this is where you'd put it. As is, it just creates a new game.

We want to change this line to 

```
//Make a new flixel game of resolution 256x144 that starts on PlayState
AddChild(new FlxGame(256, 144, PlayState))
```

This line essentially says: 
1. Make a new Flixel Game
2. With resolution 256x144 (which is a widescreen 16:9)
3. And start it on PlayState

PlayState is our first State, which is just what it sounds like - a state of your game. With game dev (and programming in general) you want to focus on compartimentalization - seperating a big task into several smaller tasks. The biggest of these tasks in a game is seperating them into these States. For example, we can have a Menu State, Highscore State, and of course, Play State.

For our tutorial, the majority of our work with placing things on the game to be played with (player, enemies, levels, etc.) will be done in PlayState.

Creating the Player

We're going to essentially add some scaffolding for a Player. We want our player to:

1. Walk
2. Jump/Jetpack
3. Shoot
4. And get hit
